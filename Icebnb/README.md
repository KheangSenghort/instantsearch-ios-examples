This example imitates a bed and breakfast search interface like well-known applications.

- Search a place by **your location** around you
- Filter with Numberic filters by **radius**
- Filter with RefinementList by **room_type**
- Filter with Numeric filters by **price**
- Custom views using `AlgoliaWidget` for filtering by **price** and **room_type**
- Custom widgets for linking the search results with the `MKMapView`
